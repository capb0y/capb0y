Hey, I am Divyansh. I am an international student from Indore, India. I’ll try to introduce myself by introducing things I love. 

I love the quote “Life is worth living because of our problems, not in spite of them”. It has helped me navigate through tough times, and the simple idea that our problems are what makes life interesting is so beautiful. I feel you could apply this idea to math as well.

I love philosophy. I believe math and physics come under it. If you’d see my youtube search history, a lot of it is physics. For me, physics is the only objective thing in our subjective universe. I find it very beautiful, even though I comprehend like 20 percent of what I see. I love the idea that math is so complete, that all sides join together without any irregularities, just goes on to show how “fundamental” it is.

I love going out of my comfort zone and doing things I have never done before! At Colby, I have already signed up for co-president elections, choir lessons (half of my class has an age of 50+), volunteering to help immigrant kids, and joining this class. (I am glad I did)

For reasons relating to legality and my safety, I will not be discussing my political standpoints p: ,but I’d say I am very open to different schools of thought. 

I love my sisters. Coming from a low income family in India, My sisters(30, and 28) broke gender barriers to gain education and get amazing jobs. It is because of them that I am here at Colby. They’ve guided me throughout, supported my dreams financially, and inculcated feminist values onto me. I lost one of my sisters 3 months ago, but I like to believe that she’s here, proud that I made it. I love you and I miss you, sajal di.
